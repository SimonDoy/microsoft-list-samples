# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the Microsoft List scenarios.

## Social Media Grabber
The social media grabber folder has the assets used by the Microsoft Lists and Power Platform solution which allows you to retrieve the contents of an RSS feed and add it to a Microsoft List. The scenario that it has been built for is to allow a Marketing department keep up to date with the latest blog news from Microsoft using RSS feeds.

### Installation

Use the Microsoft PnP libraries to install the Microsoft Lists into the SharePoint site of your choice.
